# House Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning model built to predict house prices. It uses a Jupyter Notebook to perform data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The model aims to provide accurate price estimations based on various features of a house.

## Project Overview

-   **Data Analysis**: The notebook explores the dataset to understand the distribution of house prices and other key features.
-   **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data.
-   **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) on the preprocessed data.
-   **Evaluation**: Assesses the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error or R-squared.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   The required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git)
    cd YourRepoName
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

This project requires a dataset to train and test the model. The dataset file should be in CSV format and is expected to be named `your_dataset_name.csv`. Make sure this file is located in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

1.  **Prepare the Dataset**: Place your dataset file (e.g., `house_data.csv`) in the same directory as the notebook.
2.  **Open the Notebook**: Open the `HousepricePrediction.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment.
3.  **Run the Cells**: Run the cells sequentially to see the model being built and its predictions.

## Project Structure

-   `HousepricePrediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with the project's code.
-   `your_dataset_name.csv`: The dataset used for the project.
-   `requirements.txt`: A list of all the Python dependencies.
-   `README.md`: This file.
-   `.gitignore`: A file to ignore unnecessary files and directories.
